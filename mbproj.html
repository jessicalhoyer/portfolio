	<h3>Summary</h3>
	<p>Moonbeam Publishing was my final project for my scripting languages class. For this assignment, we were required to build a website with JavaScript programming we had learned during class. This site was built entirely from scratch with sketches to figure out the site layout. It was then coded with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a fictional publishing website that allows you to register for classes, sign up for an email newsletter, and will calculate totals for publishing services such as book editing and printing book copies. It does all of this using Javascript code and will validate all forms to check for errors.</p>
